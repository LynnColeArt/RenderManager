# Render Manager WordPress Plugin

## About

Render Manager is a WordPress plugin designed to showcase advanced development techniques within the WordPress ecosystem. While not intended for general use, it serves as a technical demonstration of specific functionalities.

What I'm aiming to do is create a plugin that catalogs large collections of AI generated images, scrapes them for their meta data, and stores the image and the meta data in Wordpress in a way that's easy to be referenced, should you ever 
desire to revisit a prompt, or see what settings ou used to create something. 

At the moment, the system supports all of the contradictory and arbitrary fields created by Automatic1111 when rendering. It has not been tested against renders made in ComfyUI, or other types of diffusion methods like Midjourney.

I also took the liberty of making some banal fruit and vegitable themed renders, that I'm including as sample data. However, any zip file with Stable Diffusion renders in it should work.

## Technical Highlights
